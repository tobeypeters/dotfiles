  <h2><strong>Things to consider</strong>, while viewing this site:</h2>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>This is only a place, to test HTML 5 &amp; CSS3 source code.</li>
      <li>I <strong>EXPECT</strong> Javascript to be present and enabled, for this project site.  Real world, I <strong>WOULD</strong>
        add noscript logic and I may later do so.
      </li>
      <li>Ignore everything you see on this page &amp; all attached pages.</li>
      <li>You'll see jacked up colors, broken code shown on screen, etc ... 
        the ugly Colors and such are used for helping alignment.
      </li>
      <li>This site doesn't have a mobile version yet.  No CSS grids or anything like that.  Although, the default 
        behavior of standard elements resize based on the room given.  So, this site can look "decent" on a mobile device.
      </li>
      <li>Definitely, would need to add plenty of CSS to enforce font sizes and everything else, to keep everything
        formatted nicely.
      </li>
    </ul>
