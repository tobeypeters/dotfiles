<b>Description:</b>
              Running list of additions and changes made to my
              distribution of Shrine/TempleOS.

              <b>Main thing is the new command interpreter : templeDOS.HC</b>

<b>General:</b>
 * Added $LK,"tp_Compositor.HC",A="FI:C:/Home/tp_Compositor.HC"$ : Start of my custom
   compositor. Right now it overrides the mouse cursor color.
 * Added $LK,"templeDOS.HC",A="FI:C:/Apps/templeDOS/templeDOS.HC"$, $LK,"templeDOS.DD",A="FI:C:/Apps/templeDOS/templeDOS.DD"$ : Terminal command app.
 * Added $LK,"Theme.HC",A="FI:C:/Home/Theme.HC"$ : Allows easy'ish color theming.

 <b>Modied system files ... : c:/Home/patchos</b>
