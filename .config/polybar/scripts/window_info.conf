#                         [ignore]  - Classes you want window_info to completely ignore 100%.
#                                     strip_class_from_title() will not be called
#
#                         [exclude] - Classes you want window_info to `ignore`, when displaying
#                                     the title.  i.e. titles with valid "-" in them.
#                                     For example: I have a Chrome session, I manually change
#                                     the classname to `Netflix`. But, the title still has "- Google Chrome", on the end.
#
#                                     Example:  Netflix - Google Chrome
#
#                                     I just want: Netflix
#
#           <classname> - Listed under one of the above mentioned sections.
#                         Don't wrap it in quotes or anything.
